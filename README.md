# PSCollection
I do have many many PowerShell modules and scripts that I'll start to upload to PSGallery and also here at GitHub.  
I'll publish them at my [blog](https://stolpe.io) and they will be also be published at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rstolpes), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rstolpe/) and [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/profiles/rstolpe).  
But beside that I'll also link them here so you can have a overview of them in a easy way.  
  
You can install any of my modules trough your PowerShell console with the following command:
Install it for all users
```
Install-Module -Name <ModuleName> -Scope AllUsers -Force
```
Install it for the current user
```
Install-Module -Name <ModuleName> -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```
